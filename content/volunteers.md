The employee association relies on volunteer effort from among our members to provide leadership and organization. All members are eligible for participation in leadership, as well as support roles in committees. As a member, we value your input and hope that contribute _your_ talent and ideas to our team.

The association has four elected positions, the _Executive Officers_, as well as volunteer-based committees. The GPEA holds elections every 2 years, with the next election scheduled for 2025.

Executive Officers represent members by setting negotiating priorities, tactics and strategies, as well as by speaking by on behalf of employees during the formal contract bargaining process.

Committees help to engage with members to develop our bargaining priorities, and accomplish the hard work of translating employee priorities into potential language amendments for the next contract bargaining agreement.

## Executive Officers

The formal leadership structure of the association is the executive team, composed of four executive officers:

- President
- Vice President
- Secretary
- Treasurer
